# Authentication & Authorization

## Overview

The system uses token-based authentication with session-backed access and refresh tokens, combined with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization. There are no magic bypasses — every user, including the superadmin, is authorized through explicitly assigned permissions.

The authentication described here covers the **admin panel** only (username + password login). User-facing authentication (e.g., OTP, OAuth, SSO) is outside the scope of this blueprint and is implemented by derived projects.

## Authentication

### Admin Login

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Client
    participant API
    participant DB

    Client->>API: POST /auth/admin-login {username, password}
    API->>DB: Find user by username
    DB-->>API: User
    API->>API: Verify user is active
    API->>API: Verify password hash
    API->>DB: Enforce max active sessions (evict LRU if exceeded)
    API->>DB: Create session (access + refresh tokens, IP, user_agent)
    API->>DB: Update user last_active_at
    API-->>Client: {access_token, refresh_token, expiry timestamps}
```

- Access token TTL: 15 minutes (default)
- Refresh token TTL: 30 days (default)
- Max active sessions per user: 5 (default) — on login, least recently used sessions are evicted if the limit is exceeded

### Token Refresh

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Client
    participant API
    participant DB

    Client->>API: POST /auth/refresh-token {refresh_token}
    API->>DB: Find session by refresh token
    DB-->>API: Session
    API->>API: Verify refresh token not expired
    API->>DB: Update session with new tokens and meta (IP, user_agent)
    API->>DB: Update user last_active_at
    API-->>Client: {access_token, refresh_token, expiry timestamps}
```

Both tokens are rotated on each refresh — the old tokens become invalid.

### Logout

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Client
    participant API
    participant DB

    Client->>API: POST /auth/logout (with access token)
    API->>API: Auth middleware resolves user context
    API->>DB: Delete session by ID
    API-->>Client: 200 OK
```

### Session Cleanup

Expired sessions (where the refresh token has expired) are deleted hourly by the `clean-expired-sessions` async task.

### User-Facing Authentication

<!-- TODO: Derived project — document your user-facing authentication flow here.
     Examples: OTP via SMS/email, OAuth 2.0, SSO, magic links, etc.
     Describe: login flow, identity verification steps, session creation, token format differences (if any). -->

_Not provided by the blueprint. Implement in derived project._

## Authorization

### Request Authorization (Middleware)

Every authenticated request goes through a two-step middleware pipeline:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Client
    participant AuthMiddleware
    participant PermMiddleware as RequirePermission
    participant DB
    participant Handler

    Client->>AuthMiddleware: Request with Bearer token
    AuthMiddleware->>DB: Find session by access token
    DB-->>AuthMiddleware: Session
    AuthMiddleware->>AuthMiddleware: Verify token not expired
    AuthMiddleware->>DB: Find user by session user_id
    DB-->>AuthMiddleware: User
    AuthMiddleware->>AuthMiddleware: Verify user is active
    AuthMiddleware->>DB: Collect all user permissions (role + direct)
    DB-->>AuthMiddleware: Permissions[]
    AuthMiddleware->>AuthMiddleware: Build UserContext {user_id, session_id, permissions}
    AuthMiddleware->>PermMiddleware: Pass request with UserContext

    PermMiddleware->>PermMiddleware: Check user has required permission
    alt Has permission
        PermMiddleware->>Handler: Allow
    else Missing permission
        PermMiddleware-->>Client: 403 FORBIDDEN
    end
```

**Route protection levels:**

| Level            | Middleware                             | Example endpoints                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Unauthenticated  | None                                   | `admin-login`, `refresh-token`        |
| Authenticated    | `AuthMiddleware`                       | `logout`, `get-my-sessions`           |
| Permission-gated | `AuthMiddleware` + `RequirePermission` | `create-user`, `set-role-permissions` |

**RequirePermission behavior:**

- Accepts one or more permissions as arguments — grants access if the user has **at least one** (OR logic)
- For AND logic, chain multiple `RequirePermission` middleware calls on the same route

## RBAC

### Model

Permissions are flat strings following a `module:resource:action` convention (e.g., `auth:user:manage`). There is no hierarchy — `auth:user:manage` does not imply `auth:user:read`.

See [Auth Module ERD](../modules/auth/ERD.md) for entity relationships.

### Permission Sources

A user's effective permissions come from two sources, merged via SQL `UNION`:

1. **Role permissions** — permissions inherited from assigned roles (`user_roles` → `role_permissions`)
2. **Direct permissions** — permissions assigned directly to the user (`user_permissions`)

Duplicates are eliminated by the `UNION`. The merged set is loaded into `UserContext.Permissions` on every authenticated request.

### Superadmin

The superadmin is created via CLI (`./app auth create-superadmin`) during initial system bootstrap. It receives all permissions as **direct user permissions** — there is no special "superadmin" flag or role bypass. The superadmin is authorized through the same permission checks as any other user.

When new permissions are added to the system, they must be added to the `SuperadminPermissions()` list and re-assigned.
